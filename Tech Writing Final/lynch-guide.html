                    &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a more advanced Bloons Tower Defense 6 (BTD6) guide about beating the Lynch. The Lynch is one of the two boss
                    events that BTD6 has and can be quite complicated and difficult to beat. This guide will explain some basic strategies
                    to beat the Lynch and can even help you with the second boss (Bloonarius). You can also check out my oter beginner BTD6
                    guide on this website.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing to know is how the Lynch works. You start the game on round 1 and on round 40 you fight the first tier.
                    After the first tier on round 40 you fight the next tiers of the Lynch every 20 rounds. So you fight tier 2 on round 60
                    and tier 3 on round 80 and so on. The final tier is the fifth tier on round 120. Each tier gets more difficult and
                    slowly gains hp every tier and can be quite difficult to beat. One thing to note is that every tier has a health bar
                    displayed at the top of the screen that has skulls on it. Each time you get the Lynch's hp below a skull it will
                    become invincible and will release its soul which is a smaller version of itself with less hp. It sometimes even releases
                    zombie MOABs and will resume taking damage when all zombie MOABs and its soul are destroyed. Another thing to remeber is that
                    the Lynch is considered a MOAB class balloon and therefor takes a lot of damage from towers such as the MOAB eliminator that does
                    extra damage to MOAB class balloons.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;The second and most important tip is money making, normally on round 40 you would have to defeat a simple MOAB class 
                    balloon. For the Lynch boss event, you have to fight the first tier of the Lynch which is much more powerful than a regular
                    MOAB. So you need to have a really good defense by round 40 and your defense needs to improve quite a bit every 20 rounds
                    in between Lynch tiers. So making sure you have plenty of farms and use as cheap of a defense as you can in between tiers. The
                    most effective farming and defensive strategies will be talked about in a different article. This article will cover some
                    general strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;Heroes are a very important part of BTD 6 and add a huge layer of depth to the game. For any boss the best hero by a long shot is
                    Benjamin. He generates a lot of money and snowballs your income by allowing you buy more farms earlier. Sauda could also be
                    a good choice if used correctly though. Sauda and a 2-0-0 alchemist could be an extremely effective defense for many rounds
                    and is very cheap which would allow you to buy more farms. Overall Benjamin is very good though and is only 3000 monkey money which
                    isn't too much. So, if you don't have Benjamin unlocked he is a great hero for bosses and even normal gamemodes.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;Good towers to beat the Lynch vary depending on the map, but in general you need very high MOAB damage. For the earlier tiers the
                    0-5-2 Bomb Shooter, 2-4-0 Submarine, and the 2-5-0 dartling gunner are very effective. The 2-0-4 ninja and 2-0-4 heli pilot are also
                    very effective towers. Although for the later tiers (tier 4 and 5) it will be difficult to beat without paragons or 6th tier monkeys.
                    The game currently has 4 paragons: The ninja, dart monkey, boomerang monkey and monkey buccaneer all have paragons which are unlocked
                    once you get all 5th tier paths for the respective tower. Paragons are extremely effective for any balloons type and do very high damage
                    even on the 4th and 5th tiers of the Lynch. A more detailed guide on paragons will be uploaded later.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;The final thing is some overall good towers and farming strategies for effectie defense and income. For the first tier using
                    2-0-3 farms is the best, starting with 1-0-0 then 2-0-0 and finally 2-0-3 which is the most effective early game farming strategy.
                    Later on you'll want to use 4-2-0 farms which are the best for later game farming. As for cheap and effective defenses tack shooters,
                    boomerang monkeys and the free dart monkey (if you have the free dart moneky unlocked using monkey knowledge) are great. If the boss
                    is on a map with a good placement for a tack shooter (such as a sharp curve or loop around a small area) the tack shooter is
                    a very effective and cheap tower. Possibly one of the best towers ever for many situations is the 3-0-2 boomerang. A 3-0-2 boomerang
                    and a 0-2-0 village are very effective for the first 40 rounds and even later if you get a 4-0-2 boomerang.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp;This article covered some basic strategies and tips for beating the Lynch in BTD6 including income strategies, cheap
                    defenses for in between Lynch tiers, and even good towers for beating the Lynch tiers. If some of the terminology
                    or concepts didn't make sense many of them were covered in my beginner BTD6 guide that can be found on this website. Thanks
                    for reading my content and if you want more BTD6 knowledge check out my other BTD6 articles.
