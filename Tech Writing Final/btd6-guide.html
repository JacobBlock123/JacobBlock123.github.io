Introduction:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloons TD 6 (BTD6) is a tower defense game where you use your towers to pop balloons as they go through the track. Your goal is to not lose all of your lives and make it to a certain round. You earn money from popping balloons and can use this to buy and upgrade your towers. This game contains over 20 towers and many heroes which add plenty of strategy and depth to the game, this strategy guide will teach you some strategies and tower combinations for BTD6.

<br><br>
The Basics:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above is an image showing the dart monkey’s upgrade paths. In BTD6 each tower has three upgrade paths each containing unique buffs and even abilities. When upgrading a tower in a game you can only have upgrades from 2 different paths and only one of those paths can go above tier 2. When talking about a monkey's upgrades you use the tier numbers in order from the top row to the bottom row. For example a 5-0-2 dart monkey would be an Ultra-Juggernaut with Enhanced Eyesight. As I said before you can only have two paths at one time, and only one can go above tier 2. So a 5-0-2 dart monkey would have the middle path blocked, and it couldn’t be upgraded to a 5-0-3 Dart Monkey because the crossbow upgrade is blocked the moment you buy the Spike-o-pult upgrade. Another example is a 0-2-5 Dart Monkey (a Crossbow Master with Very Quick Shots), in this example the top path is blocked and it can’t be upgraded to a 0-3-5 Dart Monkey. A final thing to add before we move on to more basics is that most towers only have 5 tiers, but in the case of a few special towers there is a sixth tier or a Paragon. For the Dart Monkey this Paragon is the Apex Plasma Master, all Paragons are referred to as 5-5-5.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BTD6 has a variety of maps in different difficulties. From easiest to hardest the map difficulties are: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. Each map can be played on different difficulties and gamemodes as well. Each map can be played on Easy, Medium, and Hard as well as some other special game modes such as Half-Cash and CHIMPS. All special game modes are quite challenging though and are talked about in more advanced guides, for this guide will talk about the main three difficulties which can be seen in the table below:
<br><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Difficulties</td>
        <td>Easy</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>Hard</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Start Round</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>

    <tr>
        <td>End Round</td>
        <td>40</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>80</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Tower and Upgrade Price Modifier</td>
        <td>15% Cheaper</td>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>8% More Expensive</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Lives</td>
        <td>200</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Each round gets harder and harder and can contain various types of bloons. Certain balloon types can only be popped by specific towers or upgrade paths. There are two main balloon types you want to watch out for: camo and lead. The following is a list of some towers that are great for popping these two as well as camo-lead balloons which combine the meanness of the two:
<br><br>
1) Camo
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 3-0-2 Ninja Monkey
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) 0-2-2 Wizard Monkey
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c) 0-2-4 Dart Monkey
<br><br>
2) Lead
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 0-2-2 Bomb Shooter
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) 3-0-2 Tack Shooter
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c) 1-0-2 Sniper Monkey
<br><br>
3) Camo-Lead
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 1-1-0 Sniper Monkey
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) 0-3-2 Magic Monkey
<br><br>
(Monkey villages upgraded to 0-3-0 allow all towers in its radius to pop any balloon type which is quite useful.)
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The towers above can be very useful to have on any map or difficulty. Especially a 0-3-0 Monkey Village which can buff multiple towers to be able to pop any difficult to kill balloon types.

<br><br>
Conclusion:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Starting off make sure to focus on the basics. Play easy difficulties and simply level up your towers and learn some basic aspects of the game. Remember to watch out for camo and lead balloons though, because they can really cause some chaos for new players. Also make sure to earn some monkey money which can be used to buy amazing heroes. If you want to learn more about BTD6 strategy there are many great intermediate and advanced tutorials on some important things to know such as:
