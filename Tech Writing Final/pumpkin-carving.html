&nbsp; &nbsp;This pumpkin carving tutorial will teach you how to carve the pumpkin shown in the image above. You will need a pumpkin carving knife, a pumpkin, a few paper towels, a spoon, and a candle. Any pumpkin will do, the candle (or other light source) is to light up your Jack-o’-lantern, the paper towels aren’t necessary, but there will be quite a mess so they could come in handy, and the spoon is for scraping out the pumpkin's guts.
<br><br>
The first step is prepping your pumpkin:
<br><br>
1) Carve a circular hole on the top of the pumpkin around the stem. Size doesn’t matter as long as you can fit your hand in easily.
<br><br>
2) You can now remove the circular lid you have created and move it to the side.
<br><br>
3) The pumpkin’s inside needs to be cleaned out now. You can use your hands and the spoon to remove all the insides (it doesn’t need to be perfectly clean). You can place all of the guts you remove on the paper towels.
<br><br><br><br>
The pumpkin is now ready to be carved (remember, the picture above is a general idea;you can be as creative as you want):
<br><br>
1) Carve the eyes out, you can follow the picture above or be creative and carve the eyes however you want, just make sure they are higher up on the pumpkin and far enough apart to leave room for the nose and mouth.
<br><br>
2) Now carve the nose, once again you can follow the picture above or be creative. 
<br><br>
3) The final thing to carve is the mouth. With this you can be really creative, you can change the teeth to be sharp, you can add more teeth, and many more things. Although, feel free to follow the picture again.
<br><br><br><br>
You can now make the final touches:
<br><br>
1) Place your candle or other light source in the pumpkin.
<br><br>
2) Place the circular lid back on top of the pumpkin.
<br><br>
3) Finally turn off the lights and check out your Jack-o’-lantern.
<br><br><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;If you aren’t happy with your carving you can always make some slight changes, or even just flip your pumpkin around to the back and carve that side. Another fun thing to do is to roast the seeds from the pumpkin. Now you have a great Jack-o’-lantern for Halloween and a nice snack!
