                <h2>HMTL and CSS Basics</h2>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a coding language used to create websites. HTML can do a wide variety of things and 
                    creates all the websites you see online. HTML uses tags, elements, and attributes to create these amazing websites. 
                    Although, HTML gets some help from another coding language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling of these 
                    elements. So, what are elements, attributes and tags and what is CSS?

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Elements are almost anything on a webpage, such as images, paragraphs and headers. These elements, when put 
                    together, can make awesome web pages. That’s where tags and attributes come in. Tags are what you write in your code 
                    that make these elements appear. All tags have an opening tag and many also include a closing tag. For example 
                    [p]Hello World![/p] is a paragraph element, [p] is the opening tag and [/p] is the closing tag. This example paragraph 
                    tag [p]Hello World![/p] would display the text “Hello World!” on the webpage (all square brackets in code examples
                    should actually be triangle brackets, but this is typed in an actual HTML document meaning that would affect the
                    website).

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Tags have an issue though, they can’t be styled. This means that their colour, size and other appearance related 
                    things can’t be changed and are set to default settings. This is where attributes and CSS come in. Attributes are 
                    things such as height, width, and colour. These are all changed using CSS. An example of CSS can be seen below:

                    <br><br>

                    p {
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; color: red;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; font-size: 10px;
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; line-height: 1.6;
                        <br>
                    }

                    <br><br>
                                    
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; The code above would change our simple paragraph into something more interesting. First, we change the colour 
                    attribute of our text to red, next we change the font size to 10px, and finally, we change the line height to 1.6 
                    times normal (line-height is the same as line spacing in word). The code above can be broken into different parts: 
                    First is the selector which is simply the “p” before the curly brackets (this is selecting all [p][/p] tags), second 
                    are the properties/attributes which are “color”, “font-size” and “line-height”, which decide the attribute of the 
                    selected element that will be changed, and finally we have the values which are “red”, “10px” and “1.6”, these are 
                    values given to each attribute.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; A final thing to add is about the different types of HTML elements. HTML elements can be categorized as block or 
                    inline. Block elements are elements that by default go on separate lines from other elements. Inline elements don’t 
                    separate and simply go beside other elements.

                    <br><br>

                    Example #1 Inline Elements:
                    <br>
                    [element1] [element2]
                    <br>
                    Example #2 Block Elements:
                    <br>
                    [element1]
                    <br>
                    [element2]

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the examples shown above we can see the two different types of elements. Example #1 shows element2 as an inline 
                    element and Example #2 shows element2 as a block element. You can change an element to inline or block using the 
                    “display” attribute in CSS, this can be seen in the examples below:

                    <br><br>

                    Example #1
                    <br>
                    p {
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; display: inline;
                        <br>
                    }

                    <br><br>
                        
                    Example #2
                    <br>
                    p {
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; display: block;
                        <br>
                    }

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; In this article we learned some basics of HTML and CSS and what they are. I hope you enjoyed the article, if you 
                    want to learn more about CSS and HTML you can further into some intermediate articles about web development.

                <h2>SSL</h2>

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol that keeps internet connections secure. It does this by protecting 
                    information from being stolen as its transferred from one system to another system. These systems could be clients 
                    or servers. For example, when you access your Gmail you are accessing a web server as a client of that web server. 
                    When sending and receiving emails there is a good chance SSL is being used to secure the connection and protect the 
                    information being transferred. Although SSL has been replaced by Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS isn’t much 
                    different from SSL, and simply replaced SSL and has some improved security features.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Security when using the internet is very important. When sending messages, emails and accessing files over the 
                    internet you are very vulnerable to cyber security threats. Your data such as personal information and 
                    email/message history can be broken into by hackers during transport. Your emails and messages and account 
                    information can contain your name, age, address, postal code and even your credit card information. That’s where 
                    TLS comes in. It helps to protect your data and information from cyber security threats. You can tell the website 
                    your accessing is secured by TLS by the padlock symbol beside the website URL. This means the website is using 
                    Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS). This is the secure version of Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP). 
                    The secure version uses TLS to secure web communications.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Encryption is the main thing protecting your data. Encryption is when normal text also called plaintext is 
                    encrypted and turned into ciphertext. Encryption can come in many different forms and types. For example, they can 
                    vary in key size which is the length of the encryption. Common key sizes can range from 128 bits to 256. The more 
                    bits the better the encryption. Just like any other form of physical or technological security. For example, a lock 
                    that has 8 numbers or letters has many more possible combinations than one with only 4 numbers or letters. So, 
                    256-bit encryption has more possibilities than 128-bit encryption and therefor is much more secure. TLS currently 
                    only supports key sizes ranging from 128 bits to 256 bits. Although 128-bit encryption is very secure and takes a 
                    lot of computational power to decrypt.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Another thing that SSL/TLS uses are SSL Certificates. SSL are digital certificates which are bound to 
                    cryptographic keys. These keys are then used to secure sessions between a user (client) and the web server. For the 
                    browser to trust the certificate is must have the same URL of the website using it, be issues by a legitimate 
                    Certificate Authority (CA) and not be expired. So, a digital certificate is basically a websites identification 
                    almost like a driver’s license. It identifies the website and identifies that it’s a secure website. The reason 
                    these certificates are given by Certificate Authorities which are trusted organizations. These organizations make 
                    sure that sites are secure and that online interactions can be done securely.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, when using the internet and accessing various websites, it’s a good idea to search for the 
                    padlock icon beside the URL. It isn’t do or die, but it helps to secure your personal information and make your 
                    online interactions private.
