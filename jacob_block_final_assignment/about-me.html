                <p>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello there! I'm Jacob Block, the picutre above shows me in 2018 with my sister and my dad, I grew up and continue to live in Winnipeg Manitoba. I love technology and have for a
                    long time and made this blog to share my love for tech with others who share this passion. I also have a lot of
                    other interests though. I love to play the guitar, I love playing badminton, I enjoy card games and board games,
                    and I love the outdoors and camping.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; I always loved being active (as most kids do). I was always running around and barely ever stopped moving.
                    I played all sort of sports such as soccer, volleyball, flag football and basketball. But I also loved
                    video games. When I was quite young, probably around when I was 7 or 8, I got a Wii. This sparked my love
                    for video games. After the Wii I got an Xbox One, then I got a PS4, and finally I built my own PC. Building my
                    own PC is the main thing that sparked my interest in tech. I enjoyed the experience and proccess of building the
                    PC so much that I built many more after. This is what really got me into computer hardware, and naturally I also
                    began to become interested in the software side of computers. I learned a lot a out software and hardware through
                    a program called PTEC, which is an advanced technology program that sent me to MITT in grade 11. Since the start
                    of PTEC in grade 9 and going to MITT in grade 11 I have continued to learn about tech and my passion for it has
                    only grown.

                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for visiting my blog! I hope you enjoy what you read and continue to learn more about tech. If you want to
                    get in touch with me you can go to the websites contact me page or go to any of my social media pages.
